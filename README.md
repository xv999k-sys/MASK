KMASK Project Overview

KMASK is a deep learning project designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The system is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks.

The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images, containing two classes: Mask and No Mask. Through training and optimization, the model achieved an accuracy of 94% with a loss value of 0.91, demonstrating reliable performance in real-world scenarios.

To make the project user-friendly and accessible, KMASK is integrated with a simple web interface developed using HTML and CSS. This interface allows users to easily upload or test images and instantly see whether the system detects a face mask or not.
